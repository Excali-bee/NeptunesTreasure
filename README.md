<p align="center" >the main idea of the mod is to give you the freedom to assemble several different builds for your character without that rule of using the weapons that were made for each class, with very different ideas so you can have fun in a new way

<p align="center" >Artifacts are the foundation of the mod, all of them were designed to bring a different experience from vanilla terraria, some like AÃ§ai Berry only change the Summoner class, but there are several types that use two classes creating a hybrid idea and even some that change all classes at the same time</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" >after so much time playing I realized how badly used tridents, most of the times I used melee, I had never used any tridents other than the ones at the beginning of the game, so I decided to rework them. The main change in them was the damage class that is no longer melee and becomes magical, in addition to that now all attacks launch projectiles that when in contact with some liquid, it empowers into something stronger
